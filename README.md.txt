# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

A Machine Learning project that predicts a student’s final exam score from study hours, attendance, and past academic performance.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression models: Linear Regression & Decision Tree
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Streamlit web app for real-time prediction
- Trained model saved using joblib
